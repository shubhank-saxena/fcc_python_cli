Comments are lines of code that Python will intentionally ignore. 

Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later 
need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in Python:

Using # will tell Python to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

# This is an in-line comment.

Unfortunately there is no multi-line comment system in Python.
Instead we use a method know as docstrings. These are not comments
but a workaround to that approach.

\''' This is a
workaround multi-line comment \''' 

Best Practice
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. 
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

Try creating one of each type of comment -

1. You should create a // style comment that contains at least five letters.

2. You should create a /* */ style comment that contains at least five letters.''')
